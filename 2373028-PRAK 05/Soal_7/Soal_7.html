            It’s hard to tell what goes through a baby 
            elephant’s mind when its mom is trying to put 
            it to sleep. Do you think baby elephants wake 
            up in the middle of the night and cry? Do <br>
            their moms and dads take turns getting up
            with them to rock them back to sleep? How <br>
            do you rock an elephant, anyway? <br><br>

            And what about gorillas? Today in the paper <br>
            there’s a story about a new gorilla that was <br>just
            born in Franklin Park. Its mom is holding <br> on to it
            just like any proud human mom. And I have to wonder 
            if they go through as much trauma as that human mom 
            when it comes to sleep, and food, and diapers, 
            and running into the street. <br><br>

            Why is it so easy for them? Are they better parents?
            Do they just not worry about every little detail?
            I’ve never known a gorilla to read and study 
            carefully seventeen books on bringing up baby gorillas. 
            And they seem to know just what to do. They never 
            worry about spoiling their little gorilla babies. 
            They never worry about not having enough time 
            with them. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’d rather be 
            human than a gorilla any day. Just imagine what it’s 
            like in a zoo. Forget discrete nursing… 
            (Did you figure out yet that while gorillas 
            were on my mind, I could only find a picture of the elephant?)
